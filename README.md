# Wearher App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

Hi there! I'm Emanuel!

This project is the result of using my recently-learned React skills. 

I used hooks and Material UI framework to build the interface.

I tried to generate a good app from a clean code perspective. However, I know that there are a lot of thinks that can be improved like the usage of context hook, create custom componenet to reuse templates for UI, etc.

Any feedback is welcome!

## Getting started

You can clone/download the project using this command:

    'git clone https://github.com/emanuelcastro96/weather-forecast-app.git'

(I'm currently on the process of uploading this to Github Pages. Sorry for this inconvenient.)

## Installing dependencies

In the root folder of the project, you need to run this command:

    'npm install'

## Run the project

In the root folder of the project, you need to run this command:

    'npm start'

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Additional considerations

At the beggining of the project, I defined the following environment variable to protect OpenWeather API key:

    'REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY={my_api_key}'

After realizing the scope and final outcome of this project, I decided to include API key directly on the code so you can run it without any additional cofiguration.
